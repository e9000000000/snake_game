A snake game in terminal.

## Controls
You can control snake with `arrow keys` or `w a s d`, or `h j k l` like in vim.
Use `Ctrl+C` to exit.

## Configuration (optional)
You can add control keys in `input.c`, all another in `game.h`. I think you'll figure out what to do there.

## Install
You probably need to install `gcc` and `make` on your linux for comlilation,
and add them to `PATH`.
Next just run `make install` in the dir with `Makefile`.

You can start the game by run `snake`
